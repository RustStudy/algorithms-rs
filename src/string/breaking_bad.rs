/*
Given an api which returns an array of chemical names and an array of chemical
symbols, display the chemical names with their symbol surrounded by square

brackets:

Ex:
Chemicals array: ['Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'Google']
Symbols: ['I', 'Am', 'cro', 'Na', 'le', 'abc']

Output:
[Am]azon, Mi[cro]soft, Goog[le]

If the chemical string matches more than one symbol, then choose the one with
longest length. (ex. 'Microsoft' matches 'i' and 'cro')
